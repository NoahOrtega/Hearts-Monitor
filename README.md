# Hearts-Monitor
(It was gonna be called "DeFriendrillator" but that is a terrible name.)

This android app was created as a test of Google's hip new declarative UI framework Jetpack Compose, and Google's hip new UI components from the Material 3 pallete. 
I can't wait until Compose supports more than about half of the beautiful elements they designed! ðŸ˜… Regardless, it was a great experience learning how Material Design and Compose mesh.

This app was also made to help face a problem many android developers such as myself suffer from, self social isolation :). 

### Playstore blurb:

>Do you have trouble keeping in touch with friends and family?
>This app is designed to help you push past the anxiety that comes with modern communication by setting reasonable intervals for checking in with people you want to keep close.
>In our busy lives it's easy to lose track of the last time we talked with loved ones. Technology has made it simple to connect with anyone at any time, yet people feel more isolated than ever despite this freedom. Many of us, especially those with neurodivergence, feel overwhelmed by the demands and expectations of instant communication. Consequently, we find ourselves leaving people that matter to us on read, forgetting to message them back for days, weeks, or perpetually.
>I hope my app can help you to break this cycle of shame and isolation with gentle reminders to maintain your cherished relationships.
